## DiscordEthereumBot
A discord bot that would scrape Ethereum contracts data and update in the discord server as per request.

## Logical Segmentation of Code
1. Scrape data from URL "https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified/1?ps=100"
2. Store the data in "ethereum_contracts.csv"
3. Run the "ethereum_contracts_scrape" file which would run the discord bot.
